# ISS-the-storys-of-the-parts-


I had never done infographics before, and although I was excited to start with the task, the actual topic of conquering outer space was foreign territory.

The research I did included watching a number of documentaries and reading a lot of articles. I looked at a number of infographics, studied the NASA site, and watched BBC cosmic weather reports. By the end of it, I knew how exactly my human body would react to the temperatures and atmosphere on Venus, the names and favorite foods of all the current Astronauts, and the whole story of the cold war.

And even after finding out all the little anecdotes and the tragedies which were the result of miscommunication between the Soviet Union and USA, I still wasnâ€™t sure where to start.

**Concept**

The concept was to create a poster where you can learn about the current parts of the ISS ad about their history. I compared the different images there already are, trying to find out what is where, and did research on the Russian Roskosmos page in order to learn the right parts.

After making sure I knew each part and its full biography, I started writing down little texts and began drafting.

I wanted to experiment with the colors and see if the theme would still be visible and clear, even if I separated with the gloomy star sky look I've seen so many times before. The cold light pink background reminded me of retro-futurism, as in *2001: A Space Odyssey* and *Barbarella.*

Since this was my first experience creating an infographic, there were a few mistakes I made in the process. In my wish to make the infographic subtle and calm, I picked colors that are hardly visible and barely distinctive from one another. That harms the information flow, because you can't tell the difference between the colors of the Russian modules and the Jaxa ones.

I see the mistakes now very clearly, and it was a valuable lesson.
